# To-Do Feature List

A collection of planned features, basically acting as a roadmap without the structured progression part.

- Full tooltip reordering through an in-game UI.
  - Maybe this can be tweaked per-item?
  - Modded tooltip support will need to be considered.
  - Further individual tweaking of each tooltip through the same system. Consideration will need to be put in with this one.
    - Custom coloring, maybe some other visual effects(?), custom text with the use of variables, etc.
  - These tweaks would probably be handled through JSON and should be sharable.
  - Allow users to change when tooltips can appear (i.e. when holding modifier keys such as Shift and Alt).
- Modifiable background color and tooltip anchor positioning.
- Tooltip showing the mod that owns this tooltip, as well as the item's internal name.
- Tooltip that shows the item's ID.
- Toggleable pulsing text (per-line optionally?).
- Ammo-related tooltips.
- More literal representations of numerous stats.
  - Depending on the stat, representation in human-readable time (probably seconds), game ticks, etc. (configurable)
- MAYBE configurable letter spacing (existing system for text drawing makes this hard).
- Configurable line spacing (per-line optionally?).
